- Customer-facing web & mobile applications  
- Product browsing, ordering, payment, and delivery tracking  
- Administrative panel for inventory, order processing, and customer support  
- Secure, scalable, globally deployable architecture

## Glossary
- **SRS** â€” Software Requirements Specification  
- **API** â€” Application Programming Interface  
- **UI/UX** â€” User Interface / User Experience  
- **PII** â€” Personally Identifiable Information  
- **GDPR** â€” General Data Protection Regulation  
- **PCI DSS** â€” Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
